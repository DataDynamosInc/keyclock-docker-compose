# Keycloak local Docker Compose

This repository contains a Docker Compose file for setting up Keycloak, an open-source Identity and Access Management solution, using Docker containers.

## Usage

To use this Docker Compose setup, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DataDynamosInc/keyclock-docker-compose.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

    ```bash
    cd keyclock-docker-compose
    ```

3. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

4. Customize the `docker-compose.yml` file if needed. You can adjust environment variables, ports, volumes, etc., to fit your specific requirements.

5. Run the Docker Compose command to start Keycloak:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

6. Once Keycloak is up and running, you can access the Keycloak Admin Console by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/auth` in your web browser. Log in with the default administrator credentials (username: `admin`, password: `admin`).

7. You can now configure Keycloak according to your requirements, create realms, clients, users, etc.

8. To stop Keycloak and remove the containers, run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Notes

- This setup provides a basic configuration for running Keycloak in a Docker environment. For production deployments or specific use cases, additional configurations and security measures may be necessary.
- Make sure to review and adjust security settings, such as passwords, tokens, SSL certificates, etc., to ensure a secure deployment.
